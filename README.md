# Ticket-Sale-App
Full-Stack Ticket Sale application developed using Java (client) and C# (server). The application is developed using the Client-Server model and the data is serialized using Googleâ€™s Protocol Buffers data format. I integrated a user-friendly interface allowing vendors to select matches from a table and input client details (such as name and seat count).
